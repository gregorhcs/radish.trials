2111406200|00000000||Do I really have to decide this right now?
2111406201|00000000||Well, since we are both here anyway..
2111406202|00000000||You know I'm not here for this.
2111406203|00000000||What a wonderful place, don't you think? Calm, picturesque, lovely maidens - a small isle in this cruel land
2111406204|00000000||Mmhh. Aside from the wild bears and white wolfs hunting the villagers, the hard winters and poor medical care... it surely is.
2111406205|00000000||Ahhh. Do you always have to-
2111406206|00000000||Yes. You're idealistic dreamings will ruin you're life one day. Mind my words.
2111406207|00000000||Well, I can't be bothered for sure. Now, will you help me?
2111406208|00000000||Do I really have to decide this right now?
2111406209|00000000||Yes, of course old man!
2111406210|00000000||You know I'm not here for this. I will not get involved in your doings this time.
2111406211|00000000||Alright. The grumpy witcher is in a bad mood. You know this doesn't fare well with the ladies, don't you?
2111406212|00000000||Well, since we are both here anyway.. Surely a short detour won't cost me much time.
2111406213|00000000||Ha! Knew I could count on you. You'll get a hefty reward, I promise!
2111406214|00000000||Don't make any fast promises, Dandelion...
