2111410100|00000000||Stick to the point.
2111410101|00000000||Why this villa?
2111410102|00000000||Don’t expect any miracles.
2111410103|00000000||Taking a look will have a price.
2111410104|00000000||There’s nothing to find there.
2111410105|00000000||Greetings, good man. An ophirian merchant, if I’m not mistaken?
2111410106|00000000||I greet you, I greet you! May I introduce myself: Noret Fahleri, indeed coming from afar. Did you come to me to buy?
2111410107|00000000||Not right now. But you seem like you’ve lost your company. Care to explain what held you up?
2111410108|00000000||Are you Noret Fahleri, ophirian merchant?
2111410109|00000000||I greet you, I greet you! Is it possible my name has reached local ears already? Did you come to me to buy?
2111410110|00000000||Not right now. Your comrades at the camp are looking for you. Care to explain what held you up?
2111410111|00000000||Yes yes, of course, certainly.
2111410112|00000000||Dulla, Tollin and I came to this beautiful country to explore it, to trade in it, to enrichen it with our goods.
2111410113|00000000||Usually, we stick together, yes, but... a villa not far from here piqued my interest.
2111410114|00000000||You must understand, I always look for ways to increase my collection of artifacts and amulets, may it be the proudest in the world already.
2111410115|00000000||Stick to the point. Why does a villa in the middle of nowhere draw your attention?
2111410116|00000000||Two voices led me there - yet, upon arriving at the villa, all magic aura recipients catastrophed.
2111410117|00000000||Disturbing sounds escaped the building and I am no fool. I fled in a hurry.
2111410118|00000000||Stick to the point. Why does a villa in the middle of nowhere draw your attention? No better place around to sell?
2111410119|00000000||Certainly, yes, that’s where we will be. But, you see, two voices led me there, and they spoke of rich and undiscovered artifacts, useful only to those with the knowledge.
2111410120|00000000||Yet, upon arriving at the villa, all magic aura recipients catastrophed. Disturbing sounds escaped the building and I am no fool. I fled in a hurry.
2111410121|00000000||You still didn’t return, so what’s holding you? I can ensure you, there’s nothing good waiting in this place for you.
2111410122|00000000||I am un-sure what to do. There is my pride as a collector, but then - those obvious dangers. And honestly, the fog has me a bit lost.
2111410123|00000000||Would like to know what’s going on in the villa, and you look more the type for bravery than me. If you would go there and see what’s going on, part of the profits would certainly be yours!
2111410124|00000000||Can take a look as to what’s going on, but don’t expect me to come back with treasures on my back.
2111410125|00000000||... inhabitants?
2111410126|00000000||I wouldn’t pay so much even if you were King Radovid.
2111410127|00000000||That’s just a bit high, witcher.
2111410128|00000000||Fine.
2111410129|00000000||My patience ended! We’re done blatherin’, you’ll take the offer!
2111410130|00000000||Told you there’s nothing but misery there, I know the inhabitants of this place far too well.
