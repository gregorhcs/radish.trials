2111410400|00000000||Tell me about the spell.
2111410401|00000000||Experimental area?
2111410402|00000000||Grieving stones?
2111410403|00000000||How exactly does this spell work?
2111410404|00000000||What exactly is gonna happen when you’re free?
2111410405|00000000||Godspeed.
2111410406|00000000||Got the amulet. Better be damn worth it.
2111410407|00000000||That’s entirely up to you - again.
2111410408|00000000||Not far from here lies Olgierd’s experimental area, where he was schooling himself in The Ways, to try to lift Iris’ and his own curse.
2111410409|00000000||He didn’t succeed. Yet, everything there still has a deep connection to the villa. For the spell to work, the amulet has to be brought together with five grieving stones left there by Olgierd.
2111410410|00000000||What experimental area?
2111410411|00000000||One of Olgierd's many fruitless attempts of ending what he had no authority over. A few steps to the north. He spent a great deal of time there.
2111410412|00000000||He should have spent it with Iris instead.
2111410413|00000000||Know anything about those grieving stones?
2111410414|00000000||A fitting name, given by Olgierd.
2111410415|00000000||Once mere pebbles, they possess the signature of Olgierd, Iris, the villa and its curse.
2111410416|00000000||What exactly are they needed for?
2111410417|00000000||They serve as anchors to the curse.
2111410418|00000000||Understand them as the spell's eyes, which we need to deceive.
2111410419|00000000||How exactly is the spell performed? Hopefully no blood sacrifices involved? 
2111410420|00000000||Not this time. Collect the stones and place them in a bowl, together with the amulet.
2111410421|00000000||Speak these lines afterwards.
2111410422|00000000||Then, wait until midnight.
2111410423|00000000||If you make no mistake, our curse will be broken, and Iris will be free.
2111410424|00000000||How exactly does this spell work?
2111410425|00000000||In the play of this curse, our roles will be replaced by... substitutes.
2111410426|00000000||We will not bother explaining it further. It would be a futile attempt to someone so... human.
2111410427|00000000||What exactly is gonna happen when you’re free?
2111410428|00000000||We’ll wait for your return in order to fulfill our end of the contract.
2111410429|00000000||As promised, we’ll show you the outcome of your efforts.
2111410430|00000000||I won’t hold my breath.
2111410431|00000000||Neither does Iris.
2111410432|00000000||On my way.
