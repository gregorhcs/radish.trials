2111410750|00000000||What in all the god’s names was going on in this mansion...?
2111410751|00000000||Nothing worth your time.
2111410752|00000000||I greet you, I greet you! Were you able to help those poor spirits, friend?
2111410753|00000000||Can’t say I was. Demons still roam the place, so you better stay as far away as you can.
2111410754|00000000||What a pity, all the opportunities left there. I may, however, praise my famous intuition, leaving as soon as I could. Oh, and the poor spirits, no doubt. Shame, that. 
2111410755|00000000||Why on earth didn’t you tell me the amulet was a magical catalyst?
2111410756|00000000||Aren’t you the witcher with famous sorceress-friends? I assumed you knew what it was and did, paying all those coins for it. 
2111410757|00000000||Arrgh.. I’m on the verge of doing things I would later regret. Better don’t say no more, or there might be one more spirit in the not-so-far future.
2111410758|00000000||Now, now. If there's anything I can do to save our valuable Seller-Customer-Relationship as well as my good name in this new country, go ahead. 
2111410759|00000000||Actually, there might be something. These words mean anything to you?
2111410760|00000000||Yees, I'm beginning to remember... a very old, very rare language... of demonic origins, no less... did you get this from the spirits?
2111410761|00000000||Be that as it may, have once again my gratitude for advising me back there, dear witcher! As a sign of gratitude and closure, I'll translate those words for you. Wait but a moment.
2111410762|00000000||Quite an interesting poem, no doubt - although rather nonsensical if you know the language. No demon would ever use it seriously. Maybe it's different for... 'spirits' of your country?
2111410763|00000000||Rather wouldn't wish to cross words with those spirits ever again. Farewell.
