2111410100|00000000||Stick to the point.
2111410101|00000000||Why this villa?
2111410102|00000000||Don’t expect any miracles.
2111410103|00000000||Taking a look will have a price.
2111410104|00000000||There’s nothing to find there.
2111410105|00000000||Greetings, good man. An ophirian merchant, if I’m not mistaken?
2111410106|00000000||I greet you, I greet you! May I introduce myself: Noret Fahleri, indeed coming from afar. Did you come to me to buy?
2111410107|00000000||Not right now. But you seem like you’ve lost your company. Care to explain what held you up?
2111410108|00000000||Are you Noret Fahleri, ophirian merchant?
2111410109|00000000||I greet you, I greet you! Is it possible my name has reached local ears already? Did you come to me to buy?
2111410110|00000000||Not right now. Your comrades at the camp are looking for you. Care to explain what held you up?
2111410111|00000000||Yes yes, of course, certainly.
2111410112|00000000||Dulla, Tollin and I came to this beautiful country to explore it, to trade in it, to enrichen it with our goods.
2111410113|00000000||Usually, we stick together, yes, but... a villa not far from here piqued my interest.
2111410114|00000000||You must understand, I always look for ways to increase my collection of artifacts and amulets, may it be the proudest in the world already.
2111410115|00000000||Stick to the point. Why does a villa in the middle of nowhere draw your attention?
2111410116|00000000||Two voices led me there - yet, upon arriving at the villa, all magic aura recipients catastrophed.
2111410117|00000000||Disturbing sounds escaped the building and I am no fool. I fled in a hurry.
2111410118|00000000||Stick to the point. Why does a villa in the middle of nowhere draw your attention? No better place around to sell?
2111410119|00000000||Certainly, yes, that’s where we will be. But, you see, two voices led me there, and they spoke of rich and undiscovered artifacts, useful only to those with the knowledge.
2111410120|00000000||Yet, upon arriving at the villa, all magic aura recipients catastrophed. Disturbing sounds escaped the building and I am no fool. I fled in a hurry.
2111410121|00000000||You still didn’t return, so what’s holding you? I can ensure you, there’s nothing good waiting in this place for you.
2111410122|00000000||I am un-sure what to do. There is my pride as a collector, but then - those obvious dangers. And honestly, the fog has me a bit lost.
2111410123|00000000||Would like to know what’s going on in the villa, and you look more the type for bravery than me. If you would go there and see what’s going on, part of the profits would certainly be yours!
2111410124|00000000||Can take a look as to what’s going on, but don’t expect me to come back with treasures on my back.
2111410125|00000000||... inhabitants?
2111410126|00000000||I wouldn’t pay so much even if you were King Radovid.
2111410127|00000000||That’s just a bit high, witcher.
2111410128|00000000||Fine.
2111410129|00000000||My patience ended! We’re done blatherin’, you’ll take the offer!
2111410130|00000000||Told you there’s nothing but misery there, I know the inhabitants of this place far too well.

2111410200|00000000||I’m listening.
2111410201|00000000||Tell me more about this spell.
2111410202|00000000||What will you do when you’re free?
2111410203|00000000||Sorry, I cannot trust you.
2111410204|00000000||So you’re still here, huh?
2111410205|00000000||There are not many places for us to go, as you’re well aware.
2111410206|00000000||Is there any particular reason for your second visit?
2111410207|00000000||There’s a flustered merchant not far from here, lured to this villa by mysterious voices.
2111410208|00000000||You wouldn’t happen to know anything about it?
2111410209|00000000||Yes. That was us.
2111410210|00000000||I take it you’ll explain your reasons any second now?
2111410211|00000000||The same reasons for everything we do nowadays. Iris is suffering, every moment in this world an ordeal for her. We expect not for it to move you. You’re a witcher.
2111410212|00000000||Not that it tears our hearts apart.
2111410213|00000000||I get it. It was a hard decision to make and it’s not like I’m not sorry for how it turned out for the three of you. Don‘t get what it has to do with the merchant, though. 
2111410214|00000000||He trades in amulets. One of those happens to own a powerful demonic signature we perceived.
2111410215|00000000||We mused it over. We need it. Combined with an old spell of our knowledge, it can free us from this curse, replacing our roles here with artifical substitutes.
2111410216|00000000||Unfortunately, he proved himself a coward. And would it be different, he would still not help us as we are.
2111410217|00000000||I hope you don’t remember me as more likely to help you.
2111410218|00000000||No. We remember you as more likely to help Iris.
2111410219|00000000||Help with this spell to free us, so we can use our means to break this curse of mere human nature. Iris will be free.
2111410220|00000000||That sounds awfully generous from two demons. Really expect me to believe that?
2111410221|00000000||As you said, we are demons. Bound by contract and always true to our word. And there is no reason for us not to help Iris.
2111410222|00000000||We share her tedium. We will end it, if you let us.
2111410223|00000000||Rescuing demons sure is a bit unusual for my profession. But go on, what needs to be done?
2111410224|00000000||We need the earthly power connected to the curse of this place. You’ll find it in five grieving stones not far from here, where Olgierd tested his spells.
2111410225|00000000||It might be possible to break the curse without the amulet. But it is far more dangerous to our existence, so we never dared trying.
2111410226|00000000||Retrieve the amulet from the merchant. It has black and red gems in it and particularly refined carvings. We will instruct you further once you bring it back.
2111410227|00000000||And surely you have a proposal as to how to get the amulet, right?
2111410228|00000000||Don’t draw attention. Do it peacefully.
2111410229|00000000||Don’t waste time. Do it forcefully.
2111410230|00000000||Thanks for the advice.
2111410231|00000000||You’re the witcher. You’ll figure it out.
2111410232|00000000||As you always do.
2111410233|00000000||Can you tell me anything more about this curse-breaking spell of yours?
2111410234|00000000||It’s ancient, as are we. Useful, if done right.
2111410235|00000000||Never tested by us. It certainly has worked with others of our kind.
2111410236|00000000||Any examples you want to share?
2111410237|00000000||None you would have ever heard of.
2111410238|00000000||And if you’re free, what will you do then?
2111410239|00000000||Go back.
2111410240|00000000||Where we came from.
2111410241|00000000||Some kind of demon realm?
2111410242|00000000||It’s ancient, as are we. Useful, if done right.
2111410243|00000000||Never tested by us. It certainly has worked with others of our kind.
2111410244|00000000||I cannot accept this task. You two are way too suspicious to be trusted.
2111410245|00000000||As you wish.
2111410246|00000000||We will be here for eternity, as you well know.
