2111410700|00000000||The always-helpful witcher returns.
2111410701|00000000||The shame of betrayal all over his face.
2111410702|00000000||Should’ve followed my instincts. Of course there’s no trusting two wretched demons.
2111410703|00000000||Yet, we told no lie.
2111410704|00000000||We never said you could succeed. You did what we told you, and you received a free Iris in return - multiple, in fact.
2111410705|00000000||So this little game of yours was about getting your revenge on me for me not freeing you? I feel sorry for Iris. Not so much for you.
2111410706|00000000||Revenge had no part in it. Merely a small stage play to kill the overwhelming time in our eternal prison of drabness and repetition.
2111410707|00000000||Starring a witcher who once again achieved exactly as much as the last time he tried. A tragedy, truly, but not without irony.
2111410708|00000000||Honestly tried to help you again, and you threw it in the wind. Iris would have deserved help as she had a soul, you however, are empty and hollow, like evil.
2111410709|00000000||If it’s of any comfort to you, you will be able to walk away from here now, forgetting about us and moving on with your honorable existence. We will stay:
2111410710|00000000||In this mansion, in this misery
2111410711|00000000||..in all ways, for always.
2111410712|00000000||Anyway, we will fulfill our duty of presenting a reward for your troubles. You got the amulet and perfectly recited the words we gave you, useless as they may have been. There, look at your feet. Regard it as our last parting gift. 
2111410713|00000000||Don’t expect me to shower you with gratitude.
2111410714|00000000||Don’t worry about that. The sword is more burden than pleasure, as is our continued stay in the mansion of Von Everec.
2111410715|00000000||We will take our leave now, as much as we hate to part with you.
2111410716|00000000||We will tell Iris you came to visit. She shall be pleased.
2111410717|00000000||Go to hell.
2111410718|00000000||If only we could.
